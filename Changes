        Apparently we have to leave a $VERSION in lib/PDF/TextBlock/Font.pm
        or PAUSE gets mad at us when we upload. We don't have to increment that
        $VERSION, but it can't go away.

        Status: Decreasing version number
        =================================
            module : PDF::TextBlock::Font
            version: undef
            in file: PDF-TextBlock-0.09/lib/PDF/TextBlock/Font.pm
            status : Not indexed because
                    PDF-TextBlock-0.08/lib/PDF/TextBlock/Font.pm in
                    J/JH/JHANNAH/PDF-TextBlock-0.08.tar.gz has a higher version
                    number (0.04)
